## Overview

**Heating Control** This Heating Control project is a school project developed as part of our curriculum. The primary goal of the project is to build knowledge and practical skills in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically in the context of temperature control systems.

While the application intelligently regulates indoor heating systems using advanced machine learning algorithms and dynamically adjusts the supply temperature based on various parameters, it's important to emphasize that this project is a learning tool. It has been created by students for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial use or implementation in real-life scenarios.

The project serves as an excellent platform for us, the students, to explore and understand the complexities of AI technology in a practical setting. However, it should be noted that the project, in its current form, is not designed for production use.
It's important to note that this project is conceptual and developed primarily for academic exploration and learning. It is not intended for commercial use or deployment in real-world heating systems.
## Key Features

- **Intelligent Temperature Control**: The core of this project is a machine learning model that takes input data such as outdoor temperature, predicted outdoor temperature, preferred indoor temperature, maximum supply temperature, and heating system characteristics (gradient and baseline). Based on this data, it predicts the optimal supply temperature to maintain comfortable indoor conditions efficiently.
- **Real-Time and Predictive Data Visualization**: The user interface displays the current supply temperature across an outdoor temperature spectrum ranging from -30°C to +20°C. It also presents a forecast showing the supply temperature and weather conditions for the next 12 hours, aiding in proactive temperature management.
- **Customizable Settings:**: Users have the flexibility to adjust key heating parameters such as the maximum supply temperature, gradient, and baseline. These settings allow for fine-tuning the system's responsiveness and efficiency according to specific user needs and preferences.

## How it Works

- **Input Data Processing**: The system takes in various parameters, including current and predicted outdoor temperatures, desired indoor temperature, and heating system characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Using the input data, the machine learning model predicts the necessary supply temperature to achieve the desired indoor conditions efficiently.
- **Output and Display:**: The predicted supply temperature is displayed on the UI, along with real-time and forecasted outdoor temperatures, providing users with comprehensive control and insight into their heating system.
