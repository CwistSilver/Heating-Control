## Overview

**Heating Control** The Heating Control Project is an innovative solution designed to intelligently regulate indoor heating systems. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, this application dynamically adjusts the supply temperature of a heating system based on current and forecasted outdoor temperatures, desired indoor temperatures, and other heating parameters.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Temperature Control**: The core of this project is a machine learning model that takes input data such as outdoor temperature, predicted outdoor temperature, preferred indoor temperature, maximum supply temperature, and heating system characteristics (gradient and baseline). Based on this data, it predicts the optimal supply temperature to maintain comfortable indoor conditions efficiently.
- **Real-Time and Predictive Data Visualization**: The user interface displays the current supply temperature across an outdoor temperature spectrum ranging from -30°C to +20°C. It also presents a forecast showing the supply temperature and weather conditions for the next 12 hours, aiding in proactive temperature management.
- **Customizable Settings:**: Users have the flexibility to adjust key heating parameters such as the maximum supply temperature, gradient, and baseline. These settings allow for fine-tuning the system's responsiveness and efficiency according to specific user needs and preferences.

## How it Works

- **Input Data Processing**: The system takes in various parameters, including current and predicted outdoor temperatures, desired indoor temperature, and heating system characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Using the input data, the machine learning model predicts the necessary supply temperature to achieve the desired indoor conditions efficiently.
- **Output and Display:**: The predicted supply temperature is displayed on the UI, along with real-time and forecasted outdoor temperatures, providing users with comprehensive control and insight into their heating system.
